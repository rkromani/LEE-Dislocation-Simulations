This repository stores a public version of my Dislocation Relaxation Simulation for Low Energy Excess Events (DRSLEEE) code. 

This code was authored by Roger K. Romani, and was first published in mid-2024.

I use this code to simulate the relaxation of dislocations at low temperatures in aluminuim, to test whether this may cause
observed Low Energy Excess (LEE) events in low thresold calorimeters.

This repository contains a Python notebook which contains all aspects of the simulation, using only publicly availible
Python packages (Numpy, Scipy...).
